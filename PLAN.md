### **Phase 1: Core Functionality and Refactoring**

This phase is all about strengthening the application's foundation. We'll implement essential features and refactor the existing code to make it more robust and maintainable.

* **1. Establish the Unified Form Schema as the Single Source of Truth**
    * **Objective**: To create a rich, technology-agnostic schema that can generate any part of a form, from the UI to validation and styling.
    * **Key Actions**:
        * Extend the existing `FormSchema` in `src/interfaces/index.ts` to include:
            * **Validation Rules**: Define validation rules in a generic format (e.g., `{ "required": true, "minLength": 2 }`).
            * **Styling and Layout Information**: Include properties for controlling the layout (e.g., grid, flexbox) and styling of the form and its components.
            * **API Integration**: Add a mechanism for specifying how the form should interact with APIs (e.g., for submitting data or fetching options for a select field).
    * **Rationale**: By creating a comprehensive and technology-agnostic schema, we can use it as a single source of truth for generating all aspects of a form. This ensures consistency and reduces the risk of errors.

* **2. Implement Form Validation**
    * **Objective**: To ensure data integrity and provide a better user experience by validating user input.
    * **Key Actions**:
        * Integrate a third-party validation library like **Yup** or **Zod** for schema-based validation.
        * Create a validation utility function that processes the form data against the JSON schema and returns a list of errors.
        * Display clear and user-friendly validation messages next to the corresponding form fields.
    * **Rationale**: Robust validation is a critical feature for any form-based application. A dedicated library provides a more powerful and flexible way to define and manage validation rules.

* **3. Refactor `FieldRenderer` Components**
    * **Objective**: To reduce code duplication and improve the maintainability of the form rendering logic.
    * **Key Actions**:
        * Create a single, generic `FieldRenderer` component that dynamically renders the appropriate field type based on the schema.
        * Use a mapping object to associate field types with their corresponding rendering components.
    * **Rationale**: This will eliminate code duplication, make the code more maintainable, and simplify adding new field types in the future.

* **4. Improve `UIEditor`**
    * **Objective**: To enhance the user experience and make the UI Editor more powerful and flexible.
    * **Key Actions**:
        * Break down the `UIEditor` into smaller, more manageable components (e.g., `FieldList`, `FieldEditor`, `OptionsEditor`).
        * Improve the drag-and-drop functionality for reordering fields.
        * Add more options for configuring fields, such as setting default values and adding validation rules.
    * **Rationale**: The current `UIEditor` is a large, monolithic component. Breaking it down will make the code more modular and easier to work with.

### **Phase 2: AI and Advanced Features**

This phase focuses on adding advanced features to the application, including AI-powered schema generation and support for more complex form logic.

* **1. Implement AI-Powered Schema Generation**
    * **Objective**: To make it easier for users to create forms by allowing them to generate schemas from natural language input.
    * **Key Actions**:
        * Integrate a large language model (LLM) API to generate a JSON schema from a natural language description.
        * Add a "Generate with AI" button to the `AIEditor` that sends the user's input to the LLM and displays the generated schema in the editor.
    * **Rationale**: AI-powered schema generation will be a key feature, making the application more user-friendly and powerful.

* **2. Add More Field Types**
    * **Objective**: To make the form generator more versatile and allow users to create a wider variety of forms.
    * **Key Actions**:
        * Add support for more field types, such as a **date picker**, **file upload**, and a **rich text editor**.
        * Create new `FieldRenderer` components for the new field types.
        * Update the `UIEditor` to support the new field types.
    * **Rationale**: This will make the form generator more versatile and allow users to create a wider variety of forms.

* **3. Implement Conditional Logic**
    * **Objective**: To allow users to create more dynamic and interactive forms.
    * **Key Actions**:
        * Allow users to show or hide fields based on the values of other fields.
        * Update the `FormRenderer` to handle conditional logic.
        * Add a new section to the `UIEditor` for defining conditional rules.
    * **Rationale**: This is a powerful feature that will allow users to create more dynamic and interactive forms.

### **Phase 3: Advanced Code Generation and Polish**

This phase focuses on building the advanced code generation engine and improving the quality, stability, and overall user experience of the application.

* **1. Build the Advanced Code Generation Engine**
    * **Objective**: To transform the Dynamic Form Generator into a powerful development tool that can generate custom code for any technology.
    * **Key Actions**:
        * Design and implement a modular and extensible code generation engine with a **core engine**, **code generation modules**, and a **templating engine**.
        * Create code generation modules for popular technologies like **React**, **Vue**, and **Angular**.
        * Implement a plugin architecture that allows developers to create their own code generation modules for other technologies.
    * **Rationale**: This will be a key differentiator for the Dynamic Form Generator, making it an invaluable tool for developers.

* **2. Add Unit and Integration Tests**
    * **Objective**: To improve the quality and stability of the application and prevent regressions.
    * **Key Actions**:
        * Use a testing framework like **Jest** and **React Testing Library** to write unit tests for all components and utility functions.
        * Write integration tests to ensure that the different parts of the application work together correctly.
    * **Rationale**: This will improve the quality and stability of the application and prevent regressions.

* **3. Improve UI/UX**
    * **Objective**: To create a more polished and intuitive user experience.
    * **Key Actions**:
        * Conduct a thorough review of the application's UI and UX.
        * Make improvements to the layout, styling, and overall user experience.
        * Ensure that the application is accessible to users with disabilities.
    * **Rationale**: A polished and intuitive UI/UX is essential for user adoption and satisfaction.

* **4. Add User Authentication**
    * **Objective**: To allow users to save and manage their forms.
    * **Key Actions**:
        * Integrate a user authentication service like **Firebase Authentication** or **Auth0**.
        * Allow users to create accounts, log in, and save their forms to a database.
    * **Rationale**: This will allow users to manage their forms and access them from different devices.
