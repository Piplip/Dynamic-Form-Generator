### **Phase 1: Core Functionality and Refactoring (Completed)**

This phase focused on strengthening the application's foundation, implementing essential features, and refactoring existing code for robustness and maintainability.

*   **1. Establish the Unified Form Schema as the Single Source of Truth (Completed)**
    *   **Objective**: To create a rich, technology-agnostic schema that can generate any part of a form, from the UI to validation and styling.
    *   **Status**: Achieved through comprehensive `FormSchema` and `FieldSchema` definitions in `src/interfaces/index.ts`, supporting validation rules, styling, layout, and API integration.

*   **2. Implement Form Validation (Completed)**
    *   **Objective**: To ensure data integrity and provide a better user experience by validating user input.
    *   **Status**: Implemented using Zod for schema-based validation in `src/utils/validation.ts`, with clear, user-friendly validation messages displayed in `FormRenderer` and individual field components.

*   **3. Refactor `FieldRenderer` Components (Completed)**
    *   **Objective**: To reduce code duplication and improve the maintainability of the form rendering logic.
    *   **Status**: Achieved with a single, generic `GenericFieldRenderer` component (`src/component/FormGenerator/FieldRenderer/index.tsx`) that dynamically renders field types based on the schema.

*   **4. Improve `UIEditor` (Completed)**
    *   **Objective**: To enhance the user experience and make the UI Editor more powerful and flexible.
    *   **Status**: `UIEditor` was broken down into smaller components (`FieldEditor`, `ThemeEditor`, `LayoutEditorModal`). Drag-and-drop functionality was explored but later removed as per user instruction. Extensive options for configuring fields, including default values and validation rules, are available in `FieldEditor`.

### **Phase 2: AI and Advanced Features (Completed)**

This phase focused on adding advanced features to the application, primarily leveraging AI for schema generation and supporting complex form logic.

*   **1. Implement AI-Powered Schema Generation (Completed)**
    *   **Objective**: To make it easier for users to create forms by allowing them to generate schemas from natural language input.
    *   **Status**: Integrated a large language model (LLM) via the Gemini API (`src/utils/ai.ts`) to generate JSON schemas from natural language descriptions, accessible through the `AIEditor`.

*   **2. Add More Field Types (Completed)**
    *   **Objective**: To make the form generator more versatile and allow users to create a wider variety of forms.
    *   **Status**: Support for various field types (date picker, file upload, rich text editor, etc.) and their corresponding `FieldRenderer` components has been implemented.

*   **3. Implement Conditional Logic (Completed)**
    *   **Objective**: To allow users to create more dynamic and interactive forms.
    *   **Status**: Implemented conditional rendering of fields based on other field values, managed through the `condition` property in `FieldSchema` and handled in `FormRenderer` and `ConditionEditor`.

### **Phase 3: Advanced Code Generation and Polish (In Progress)**

This phase focuses on building a robust AI-driven code generation engine and improving the overall quality, stability, and user experience of the application.

*   **1. Build the Advanced Code Generation Engine (In Progress - AI-driven)**
    *   **Objective**: To transform the Dynamic Form Generator into a powerful development tool that can generate custom code for any technology, relying solely on AI.
    *   **Key Actions Completed**:
        *   Transitioned to an AI-only code generation approach, removing the template engine.
        *   Implemented enhanced prompt engineering in `generateCodeWithAI` (`src/utils/ai.ts`) with detailed instructions and few-shot examples for React, Tailwind CSS, React Hook Form, and Zod.
        *   Integrated an iterative refinement and validation loop in `ReactGenerator` (`src/code-generator/frameworks/react.ts`) with a retry mechanism and feedback to the AI based on `validateGeneratedCode`.
        *   Implemented dynamic language output (TypeScript/JavaScript) for generated code.
        *   Implemented dynamic selection of compatible options (UI Library, State Management, Validation) based on the chosen framework in `Home.tsx`.
    *   **Pending Actions**:
        *   Further enhance the `validateGeneratedCode` function to include more robust checks for styling and layout adherence.
        *   Implement a more sophisticated scoring mechanism for LLM responses.
        *   Explore integrating a client-side AST parser or a server-side linter/type-checker for more robust code validation.
        *   Add support for more frameworks (Vue, Angular) in the AI code generation.

*   **2. Add Unit and Integration Tests (In Progress)**
    *   **Objective**: To improve the quality and stability of the application and prevent regressions.
    *   **Key Actions Completed**:
        *   Added unit tests for `ThemeEditor`.
        *   Fixed initial issues with `UIEditor` tests (related to `dnd-kit` which was later removed).
    *   **Pending Actions**:
        *   Write comprehensive unit tests for the AI code generation pipeline, including prompt construction, validation, and retry logic.
        *   Write integration tests to ensure the entire code generation process works end-to-end.

*   **3. Improve UI/UX (Completed)**
    *   **Objective**: To create a more polished and intuitive user experience.
    *   **Status**: Conducted a thorough review and made improvements to the layout, styling, and overall user experience. This includes integrating `useAlert` for consistent error display, adding loading indicators, exposing more `GenerationOptions`, and streamlining the AI editor UI.

*   **4. Add User Authentication (Deferred)**
    *   **Objective**: To allow users to save and manage their forms.
    *   **Status**: Deferred as per user instruction to focus on AI-related features.
