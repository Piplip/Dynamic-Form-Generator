# TODO List

## Tomorrow's Work

-   **Refactor UIEditor to fully reflect all control properties for each input field:**
    -   Ensure all properties defined in `FieldSchema` are editable through the `UIEditor`.
    -   Specifically, add controls for `labelPlacement` and `variant` properties for input fields.
    -   Add a new "Layout" accordion that will be displayed for all field types except "button". This accordion will contain dropdowns to select the `labelPlacement` and `variant` properties.
