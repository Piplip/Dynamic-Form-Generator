## Key Features

*   **Build Forms with Simple Text:** Just type out what you want in your form, and our AI will automatically create it for you. For example, you can type "a form with a name field, an email field, and a message box," and the form will be generated instantly.
*   **Drag-and-Drop Interface:** Don't want to type? No problem! You can use our intuitive drag-and-drop editor to build your form visually. Simply drag the fields you want (like text boxes, dropdowns, and checkboxes) onto the form.
*   **Instant Previews:** See your form come to life as you build it. The live preview panel shows you exactly what your form will look like.
*   **Easy Data Export:** Once you've collected responses, you can easily export the data to a JSON file or even export the entire form as an HTML file to use on your website.

## How to Use

1.  **Describe Your Form:** Start by typing a description of the form you want to create in the **AI Editor** tab. For example, "a customer feedback form with a rating scale from 1 to 5."
2.  **Fine-Tune with the UI Editor:** If you want to make changes, switch to the **UI Editor** tab. Here, you can add, remove, or rearrange fields with a simple drag-and-drop interface.
3.  **Preview Your Form:** The **Form Preview** panel on the right will update in real-time, showing you exactly what your form looks like.
4.  **Share or Export:** Once you're happy with your form, you can start collecting responses. The data you collect will appear in the **JSON Output** panel. You can also click the **Export** button to download your form as an HTML file.
